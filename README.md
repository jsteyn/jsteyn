### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍🏫 My name is Jannetta
- 💻 I'm a research software engineer
- 🕸️ My personal web page can be found at [jannetta.com](https://jannetta.com)
- ![](https://twitter.com/favicon.ico) You can find me on Twitter as [@jannettas](https://twitter.com/jannettas)
- ![](instagram_16.png) I'm also on Instagram as [jannettasteyn](https://www.instagram.com/jannettasteyn/)
- 🇿🇦 I speak fluent Afrikaans and 🇬🇧 English and a little 🇩🇪 German. I can probably ask for coffee, chop wood and walk into town in Zulu and Tswana.
- 😄 My pronouns are she/her/hers, but if I get any more weird, obviously fake, male profiles following me on Instagram, I'm going to change it to "him/his" or maybe "it".
