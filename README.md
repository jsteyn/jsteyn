### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍🏫 My name is Jannetta
- 💻 I'm a senior research software engineer
- 🕸️ My personal web page can be found at [jannetta.com](https://jannetta.com)
- 🐘 You can find me on Mastodon as [@jannettas](https://hachyderm.io/@jannettas)
- ![image](https://bsky.app/static/favicon-16x16.png) I'm on Bluesky as [@jannettas.bsky.social](@jannettas.bsky.social)

- ![South African Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Icons-flag-za.png) I speak fluent Afrikaans and ![UK flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Icons-flag-uk.png) English and a little ![German Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Icons-flag-de.png) German. I can probably ask for coffee, chop wood and walk into town in Zulu and Tswana.
- 😄 My pronouns are she/her/hers, but if I get any more weird, obviously fake, male profiles following me on Instagram, I'm going to change it to "him/his" or maybe "it".
